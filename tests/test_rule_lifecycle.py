"""RULE-LIFECYCLE-CONSISTENCY — P0 Knowledge Governance Integration Audit, STEP 01.

Registry-wide lifecycle invariants (§8.7 / DECISION-010). These tests are
read-only audits: they NEVER modify rule data — they codify the governance
checks so any future drift fails CI loudly.

RULES-EXPANSION-001 (2026-08-26): 12 EVENT_TOPIC rules (MAR-101..106 +
HLT-101..106) activated. They are evaluated by EventTopicEngine (independent
of signal_engine + matcher), so their fields are NOT in POPULATED_CONTEXT_FIELDS
and they appear in EXECUTABLE_UNREACHABLE as "active-but-inert via the BASELINE/
CYCLE_CONTEXT/DAILY_ACTIVATION path; live via EVENT_TOPIC layer".

Checks:
  1. status enum + exact distribution (draft 20 / validated 10 / active 58,
     review 0 / deprecated 0) — no deprecated rule exists to be mis-referenced.
  2. every rule carries all required schema fields.
  3. every rule's evidence_refs resolves to a real evidence file.
  4. every rule's condition fields (draft included) ∈ matcher.FIELD_SPECS —
     kills the latent risk of a draft rule activating later with an unknown
     field (matcher only raises for *executed* rules).
  5. golden expected rule_refs all resolve to the registry (or the documented
     virtual ZIWEI-MAIN-STAR-MAP provenance label) and never point to a
     draft/review rule.
  6. non-vacuous proof: for every draft rule we build a RuleContext that
     SATISFIES its conditions, yet RuleMatcher.match_all never returns it —
     i.e. the runtime matcher and the registry status are strictly consistent.
  7. change-detector for the KNOWN governance gap: the 40 pre-existing
     executable rules carry no §8.7 activation metadata (reviewer/reviewed_at).
     + the 12 newly-activated EVENT_TOPIC rules (also without reviewer; same
     documented gap — every new active rule inherits the §8.7 metadata gap
     until Spec Owner signs off). Enumerated explicitly so any future change
     forces a conscious decision.
